# public-inspection-midnight-rules

On June 22, 2022, the DC Circuit Court decided *[Humane Society of the United States v. Department of Agriculture](https://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/opinions.nsf/A72330C326BFEC8385258887004DAD10/$file/20-5291-1956030.pdf)* (USDA), finding that the agency could not withdraw a final rule that was made available for public inspection, but not published, without first going through the notice-and-comment process. More information on the background of the court decision and the midnight period can be found in [this article](https://regulatorystudies.columbian.gwu.edu/court-decision-extends-period-issuing-midnight-rules).

This project seeks to make sense of the consequences of the court's decision in *Humane Society v. USDA*, using [Federal Register data](https://www.federalregister.gov/reader-aids/developer-resources/rest-api) to quantify the scope of the public inspection documents affected.

The [Federal Register](https://www.federalregister.gov) is the daily journal of the federal government that publishes official documents such as proposed rules, final rules, agency notices, and executive orders. Before a document is published in a Federal Register issue, it is filed by the Office of the Federal Register (OFR) for “[public inspection](https://www.federalregister.gov/reader-aids/using-federalregister-gov/understanding-public-inspection).” A public inspection document is essentially a preview of the document’s contents and its estimated effective or comment dates, which are typically available the day before it will be published officially.
